Due to recent events I will take a look at the development of the corona virus. For this I have a data set from kaggle. Based on this data set, which is updated daily, I want to make a prognosis of further infection.

Since it is a very short time series, the prognosis should always be treated with caution. Regressors that influence the further development are not included. 

For the forecast I will mainly work with the fable package. This allows the forecast of data in the format tbl.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(fs)
library(readr)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)

path <- dir_ls("~/Documents/handdke_codet/static",
                                      recurse = TRUE) %>% 
                                 path_abs() %>% 
                                 str_subset("2019_nCoV_data")

data <- read_csv(path)

```

```{r, include = FALSE}
data$Date <- as.Date(strptime(data$Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S"))
```

```{r}
glimpse(data)
```

In the first step, the data is aggregated per day and then converted into a so-called tsibble, which enables a tidy evaluation of the forecast.

For the forecast I create two simple models: An ets converted by log() and a regular ets model.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

library(tsibble)
library(fable)
library(forecast)
library(feasts)

sum_data <- data %>% 
  group_by(Date) %>% 
  summarise(Count_Confirmed = sum(Confirmed)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  as_tsibble(index = Date)

forecast <- sum_data %>% 
  model(ets_log = ETS(log(Count_Confirmed)),
        ets = ETS(Count_Confirmed)) %>% 
  forecast(h = 10)

```

The results show the significant difference of the logarithmic model. The logarithmic model reflects the trend much better.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)

sum_data %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = Count_Confirmed), 
            color = "black", size = 2) +
  geom_line(data = forecast, 
            aes(x = Date, y = Count_Confirmed, color = .model), 
            size = 2) +
  xlab("Date") +
  ylab("Confirmed") +
  ggtitle("Forecasting confirmed corona virus infections") +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(title = "Forecast")) +
  theme_fivethirtyeight()
```

In this post I wanted to describe the basic possibilities of the fable package. What else is possible with the fable package, I will describe in future posts.
