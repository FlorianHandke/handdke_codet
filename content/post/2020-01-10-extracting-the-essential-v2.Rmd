This week I told Oliver about my first blog post. He said if it wasn't also possible for him to examine any text according to the principle that I showed in my July 27 post. 

But of course there are! With R you can create webapps that allow an improved user interaction. 

In order to realize the idea from the post, we will build a simple user interface, where the user can define a URL, based on which the text analysis will be done. 

For this we use [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). A library for creating webapps, dashboards and interactive documents.

After that we will host the app via [shinyapps.io ](https://www.shinyapps.io/) and make it freely accessible for users. With Sshinyapps.io up to 5 webapps with an active runtime of 25 hours can be hosted in the freeware version. Since we don't want to program a productive app that is to be used by a large number of users, this is completely sufficient.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(shiny)
```

Shiny provides a wide variety of different input and output options. In addition, there are other packages available (e.g. [shinydashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/), [shinyWidgets](https://github.com/dreamRs/shinyWidgets), ...) with extended functionality or a nicer look, but we won't use them in this context.

Shiny apps are usually split in two:
 * The ui part defines the user interface of the app.
 * The server part defines the logic including various database queries, calculations etc.
 
 The use of cheatsheets is always a good practice. A [cheatsheet](https://shiny.rstudio.com/images/shiny-cheatsheet.pdf) is also available for Shiny.
 
## Defining the UI 

Our UI will have a fairly simple structure. It is divided into a sidebar panel where the user makes his input and a main panel where the result is displayed. 

```{r define ui, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# Define UI for our application 
ui <- fluidPage(
   
   # Application title
   titlePanel("Extracting the essential app"),
   
   # Sidebar with a text input for the URL, an additional HTML argument and a start button
   sidebarLayout(
      sidebarPanel(
         textInput(inputId = "textInput_Define_URL",
                   label = "Define your URL:"),
         br(),
         p("You can additionally define a HTML argument which defines the HTML dependency."),
         textInput(inputId = "textInput_HTML_Argument",
                   label = "HTML argument:",
                   value = "p",
                   placeholder = "e.g. p"),
         br(),
         actionButton(inputId = "actionButton_Start_Analysis",
                      label = "Start Analysis")
      ),
      
      # Show the result of textrank
      mainPanel(
         textOutput("textrank_result")
      )
   )
)
```

## Defining the *server*

As mentioned before, the server contains the logic of the app. We just have to convert the code from the last post into a form that can be processed by shiny. 

```{r loading packages, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(rvest)
library(stringr)
library(udpipe)
library(textrank)
```

In order to make the app easier, we will limit ourselves to English texts for the time being. For this we load the corresponding udpipe model.

```{r load udpipe, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
udmodel <- udpipe_download_model("english")
udmodel <- udpipe_load_model(udmodel$file_model)
```

```{r define server part, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  evaluate_textrank <- eventReactive(input$actionButton_Start_Analysis, {
    
    # Scraping the selected URL with the selected HTML argument
    
    url <- input$textInput_HTML_Argument
    
    webpage <- read_html(url)
    
    text <- webpage %>% 
      html_nodes(input$textInput_HTML_Argument) %>% 
      html_text() 
    
    # Do string manipulation
    
    text <- unlist(strsplit(text, "\\. ")) %>% 
      str_replace_all(pattern = "\n", replacement = " ") %>%
      str_replace_all(pattern = "[\\^]", replacement = " ") %>%
      str_replace_all(pattern = "\"", replacement = " ") %>%
      str_replace_all(pattern = "\\s+", replacement = " ") %>%
      str_trim(side = "both") 
    
    # Annotate the text
    
    df_text <- udpipe_annotate(udmodel, text) %>% 
      as.data.frame(text)
    
    # Perform textrank
    
    df_text$textrank_id <- unique_identifier(df_text, c("doc_id", "paragraph_id", "sentence_id"))
    sentences <- unique(df_text[, c("textrank_id", "sentence")])
    terminology <- subset(df_text, upos %in% c("NOUN", "ADJ"))
    terminology <- terminology[, c("textrank_id", "lemma")]
    
    textrank <- textrank_sentences(data = sentences, terminology = terminology)
    
    important_sentences <- summary(textrank, 
                               n = 4,
                               keep.sentence.order = TRUE)
    
    return(important_sentences)

  })
  
  output$textrank_result <- renderText({
    req(evaluate_textrank())
    
    cat(evaluate_textrank(), sep = "\n")
  })
}
```

The final app is called inside R via *shinyApp()* with the components from ui and server.

```{r, eval = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

The full procedure for hosting the app on shinyapps.io can be found in the clear [user documentation](https://docs.rstudio.com/shinyapps.io/) of shinyapps.io. I will give you a brief insight here.

## Host your app

1. First we load the [rsconnect](https://github.com/rstudio/rsconnect) package

```{r load rsconnect, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(rsconnect)
```

2. Register via [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) and create an account. Choose the free version. Here you will get a token that RStudio uses to connect to shinyapps.io and host your account. Pass this token into the function *setAccountInfo()*

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
rsconnect::setAccountInfo(name="<ACCOUNT>", token="<TOKEN>", secret="<SECRET>")
```

3. The app can now be deployed either via the function *deployApp()* or via the Publish button in RStudio

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
deployApp()
```

## Summary

R Shiny in combination with shinyapps.io offers a very good possibility to develop webapps. The kit used here for Shiny-apps is by far not exhausted yet. Maybe in a future post I will go into the different possibilities that Shiny still offers.
