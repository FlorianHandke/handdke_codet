<p>The diversity of R inspires me again and again. There are incredibly many packages and a broad community that continues to work on making R even better and more practicable.</p>
<p>To keep the overview is sometimes not so easy.
Which package do I need for which application or problem?
In my daily work I always use the same packages.
They are the basis for my code and are supplemented by other packages and functions in various places.</p>
<p>Therefore I have created an overview which classifies the different packages along the workflow.
Important: There is not one tool that covers everything!</p>

<p>Get the file <a href="https://github.com/FlorianHandke/handdke_codet/tree/master/static/img/r-favs.png">here</a></p>
<p>I will try to explain the list with the help of different tasks:</p>
<div id="task-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Task 1</h2>
<p>A colleague tried to make an analysis with Excel, failed due to the complexity and is now approaching me.
The data basis is then usually available as an xlsx file.
With the so called tidyverse you can do most of these analyses.
you import the file via the <code>readxl</code> package, and you can clean, transform or extend data with <code>dplyr</code>, <code>tidyr</code> and co. the result is either a report, which you create via <code>rmarkdown</code> or another xlsx-file, which your colleague can work with.</p>
</div>
<div id="task-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Task 2</h2>
<p>A head of department cyclically requires a report with which he can evaluate certain key indicators.
Again we can fall back on <code>rmarkdoen</code>.
The data may be stored in a SQL database. You connect via <code>odbc</code>.
With the <code>dbplyr</code> package you can use the usual <code>dplyr</code>-syntax which is translated into a sql query.
After you have evaluated the data, it will be displayed in a report.
Most of the time this is done with a combination of graph and table.
People want to understand the facts, fancy graphics help them, but it is essential to understand the basis of the analysis.
It may sound odd but: Only if the users of the analysis trust the result, it is used to draw conclusions and make decisions.
As a result you could e.g. create a html-report via <code>rmarkdown</code>, which contains a <code>ggplot</code> (png) or <code>plotly</code> (SVG or WebGL) graphic.</p>
<p>Commercial solutions like RStudio Connect make my workflow easier.
I can parameterize reports, define creation times, control accesses, notify users by mail, etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="task-3" class="section level2">
<h2>Task 3</h2>
<p>I do not only want to evaluate data but also have an input of new data.
Here you can use shiny webapps. With them I can build fast and easy (or with some effort more complex user interfaces) with different interactions.
<code>shiny</code> offers countless possibilities. Based on that there are a lot of packages which enhance the user interface or add functionality (e.g. <code>shinyashboard</code>, <code>shinyWidgets</code> or <code>shinyJS</code>).
Hosting your own Shiny Server is not difficult at all. You can find instructions <a href="https://deanattali.com/2015/05/09/setup-rstudio-shiny-server-digital-ocean/">here</a>.
If you want to test something, you can host Apps for free at <a href="https://www.shinyapps.io/">shinyapps.io</a></p>
<p>The commercial version using RStudio Connect again makes the workflow very easy.
Access can be controlled via LDAP, there is load balancing that can be easily set via the UI and I can easily retrieve log messages.</p>
</div>
<div id="task-4" class="section level2">
<h2>Task 4</h2>
<p>R offers many different possibilities to apply Machine Learning.
With the packages of <code>fabletools</code> and <code>todymodels</code> I can use the tidy syntax I am used to.
For example, I can easily convert a <code>tibble</code> into a <code>tsibble</code> (:)), apply a model such as <code>ARIMA</code> or <code>ETS</code> to it and create a prediction.
Fable is based on the <code>forecast</code> package, which I also like to work with.</p>
<p>Using the <code>plumber</code> package I can configure my machine learning models as API and make them available to other systems.</p>
<p>R offers me as an experienced user the possibility to explore and display data in various forms and to draw conclusions from it.
It also offers me many interfaces to other systems and allows domain experts to interact with processed data (e.g. via reports or web apps).
These can then interpret data and draw conclusions from it.</p>
